## Mobile

> By default, chat is not available on mobile devices, and the chat button is not visible, as we believe SMS via the phone's native messaging app is the superior customer experience. 
To show the chat button and route customers to the SMS app when they tap it, simply provide a `mobileNumber` in the options object passed to the `Quiq()` initialization function. 
If you would like to instead use Webchat on mobile devices, please contact your Quiq representative, who can enable mobile chat on your tenant.
This will cause the chat button to be shown on mobile devices and a mobile-optimized Webchat UI to be displayed when they tap it.

The following mobile devices have been tested and work with Webchat:
### iOS
-   Safari 10+
-   Chrome 43+

### Android
